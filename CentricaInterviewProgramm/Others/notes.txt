1) can a store have multiple salespersons?
2) "During transition periods, if there is a shortage on salespersons, the same salesperson can be the primary salesperson
for multiple districts." - what would be the threshold for the number of salespersons required in order to allow for 1 salesperson to become the primary actor for multiple districts?
3) when a salespersons is removed from the district, what should happen to that salesperson's stores?
4) can the primary/secondary status of a salesperson be determined by the number of stores they are active in?

5) should I hand in the task somehow before the interview or would it be better to keep it as a surprise untill then?


Assumptions:
- the user is the absolute CEO of sales over the whole application, total control and represents 100% of the companie's desires.
- a store can have multiple salespersons
- the relationship type between district and salesperson cannot be determined based on the number of stores the are active in
- salesPersons can be removed regardles of their relationType to the district
- when deleting multiple salesPersons at once, failing to delete one will revert all the previous deletions
- when deleteing mutiple salesPersons at once, if one sp is not related to the district, a message would point out the outliers but the rest will be deleted
